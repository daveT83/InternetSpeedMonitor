# InternetSpeedMonitor

This is for long term monitoring of your internet speeds. This is meant to be used and scheduled on an always on machine. I created this to hold ISPs accountable. This will output a log for a given day in the provide directory. It will also out a csv file for all the results in a given day. This file can be used to send to your ISP as evidence in any conflicts you may have.
